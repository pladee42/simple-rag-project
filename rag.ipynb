Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the generation, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain- specific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs\\u2019 intrin- sic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-the- art technologies embedded in each of these critical components, providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces up-to-date evalua- tion framework and benchmark. At the end, this article delineates the challenges currently faced and points out prospective avenues for research and development 1.

INTRODUCTION L ARGE language models (LLMs) have achieved remark- able success, though they still face significant limitations, especially in domain-specific or knowledge-intensive tasks [1], notably producing \\u201challucinations\\u201d [2] when handling queries beyond their training data or requiring current information. To overcome challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant document chunks from external knowledge base through semantic similarity calcu- lation. By referencing external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the problem of generating factually incorrect content. Its integration into LLMs has resulted in widespread adoption, establishing RAG as a key technology in advancing chatbots and enhancing the suitability of LLMs for real-world applica- tions. RAG technology has rapidly developed in recent years, and the technology tree summarizing related research is shown Corresponding Author.Email:haofen.wang@tongji.edu.cn 1Resources are available at https://github.com/Tongji-KGLLM/ RAG-Survey in Figure 1. The development trajectory of RAG in the era of large models exhibits several distinct stage characteristics. Initially, RAG\\u2019s inception coincided with the rise of the Transformer architecture, focusing on enhancing language models by incorporating additional knowledge through Pre- Training Models (PTM). This early stage was characterized by foundational work aimed at refining pre-training techniques [3]\\u2013[5].The subsequent arrival of ChatGPT [6] marked a pivotal moment, with LLM demonstrating powerful in context learning (ICL) capabilities. RAG research shifted towards providing better information for LLMs to answer more com- plex and knowledge-intensive tasks during the inference stage, leading to rapid development in RAG studies. As research progressed, the enhancement of RAG was no longer limited to the inference stage but began to incorporate more with LLM fine-tuning techniques. The burgeoning field of RAG has experienced swift growth, yet it has not been accompanied by a systematic synthesis that could clarify its broader trajectory. This survey endeavors to fill this gap by mapping out the RAG process and charting its evolution and anticipated future paths, with a focus on the integration of RAG within LLMs. This paper considers both technical paradigms and research methods, summarizing three main research paradigms from over 100 RAG studies, and analyzing key technologies in the core stages of \\u201cRetrieval,\\u201d \\u201cGeneration,\\u201d and \\u201cAugmentation.\\u201d On the other hand, current research tends to focus more on methods, lacking analysis and summarization of how to evaluate RAG. This paper compre- hensively reviews the downstream tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methods applicable to RAG. Overall, this paper sets out to meticulously compile and categorize the foundational technical concepts, historical progression, and the spectrum of RAG methodologies and applications that have emerged post-LLMs. It is designed to equip readers and professionals with a detailed and structured understanding of both large models and RAG. It aims to illuminate the evolution of retrieval augmentation techniques, assess the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches in their respective contexts, and speculate on upcoming trends and innovations.

Summary of RAG ecosystem initial learning curve. 3) Specialization - optimizing RAG to better serve production environments. The mutual growth of RAG models and their technology stacks is evident; technological advancements continuously establish new standards for existing infrastructure. In turn, enhancements to the technology stack drive the development of RAG capabilities. RAG toolkits are converging into a foundational technology stack, laying the groundwork for advanced enterprise applications. However, a fully integrated, comprehensive platform concept is still in the future, requiring further innovation and development. F. Multi-modal RAG RAG has transcended its initial text-based question- answering confines, embracing a diverse array of modal data. This expansion has spawned innovative multimodal models that integrate RAG concepts across various domains: Image. RA-CM3 [176] stands as a pioneering multimodal model of both retrieving and generating text and images. BLIP-2 [177] leverages frozen image encoders alongside LLMs for efficient visual language pre-training, enabling zero- shot image-to-text conversions. The \\u201cVisualize Before You Write\\u201d method [178] employs image generation to steer the LM\\u2019s text generation, showing promise in open-ended text generation tasks. Audio and Video. The GSS method retrieves and stitches together audio clips to convert machine-translated data into speech-translated data [179]. UEOP marks a significant ad- vancement in end-to-end automatic speech recognition by incorporating external, offline strategies for voice-to-text con- version [180]. Additionally, KNN-based attention fusion lever- ages audio embeddings and semantically related text embed- dings to refine ASR, thereby accelerating domain adaptation. Vid2Seq augments language models with specialized temporal markers, facilitating the prediction of event boundaries and textual descriptions within a unified output sequence [181]. Code. RBPS [182] excels in small-scale learning tasks by retrieving code examples that align with developers\\u2019 objectives through encoding and frequency analysis. This approach has demonstrated efficacy in tasks such as test assertion genera- tion and program repair. For structured knowledge, the CoK method [106] first extracts facts pertinent to the input query from a knowledge graph, then integrates these facts as hints within the input, enhancing performance in knowledge graph question-answering tasks. VIII. CONCLUSION The summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 6, empha- sizes RAG\\u2019s significant advancement in enhancing the capa- bilities of LLMs by integrating parameterized knowledge from language models with extensive non-parameterized data from external knowledge bases. The survey showcases the evolution of RAG technologies and their application on many different tasks. The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms within the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modu- lar RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over its predecessors. RAG\\u2019s technical integration with other AI methodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, has further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in RAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve its robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts. RAG\\u2019s application scope is expanding into multimodal do- mains, adapting its principles to interpret and process diverse data forms like images, videos, and code. This expansion high- lights RAG\\u2019s significant practical implications for AI deploy- ment, attracting interest from academic and industrial sectors.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the generation, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain- specific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs\\u2019 intrin- sic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-the- art technologies embedded in each of these critical components, providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces up-to-date evalua- tion framework and benchmark. At the end, this article delineates the challenges currently faced and points out prospective avenues for research and development 1.

INTRODUCTION L ARGE language models (LLMs) have achieved remark- able success, though they still face significant limitations, especially in domain-specific or knowledge-intensive tasks [1], notably producing \\u201challucinations\\u201d [2] when handling queries beyond their training data or requiring current information. To overcome challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant document chunks from external knowledge base through semantic similarity calcu- lation. By referencing external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the problem of generating factually incorrect content. Its integration into LLMs has resulted in widespread adoption, establishing RAG as a key technology in advancing chatbots and enhancing the suitability of LLMs for real-world applica- tions. RAG technology has rapidly developed in recent years, and the technology tree summarizing related research is shown Corresponding Author.Email:haofen.wang@tongji.edu.cn 1Resources are available at https://github.com/Tongji-KGLLM/ RAG-Survey in Figure 1. The development trajectory of RAG in the era of large models exhibits several distinct stage characteristics. Initially, RAG\\u2019s inception coincided with the rise of the Transformer architecture, focusing on enhancing language models by incorporating additional knowledge through Pre- Training Models (PTM). This early stage was characterized by foundational work aimed at refining pre-training techniques [3]\\u2013[5].The subsequent arrival of ChatGPT [6] marked a pivotal moment, with LLM demonstrating powerful in context learning (ICL) capabilities. RAG research shifted towards providing better information for LLMs to answer more com- plex and knowledge-intensive tasks during the inference stage, leading to rapid development in RAG studies. As research progressed, the enhancement of RAG was no longer limited to the inference stage but began to incorporate more with LLM fine-tuning techniques. The burgeoning field of RAG has experienced swift growth, yet it has not been accompanied by a systematic synthesis that could clarify its broader trajectory. This survey endeavors to fill this gap by mapping out the RAG process and charting its evolution and anticipated future paths, with a focus on the integration of RAG within LLMs. This paper considers both technical paradigms and research methods, summarizing three main research paradigms from over 100 RAG studies, and analyzing key technologies in the core stages of \\u201cRetrieval,\\u201d \\u201cGeneration,\\u201d and \\u201cAugmentation.\\u201d On the other hand, current research tends to focus more on methods, lacking analysis and summarization of how to evaluate RAG. This paper compre- hensively reviews the downstream tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methods applicable to RAG. Overall, this paper sets out to meticulously compile and categorize the foundational technical concepts, historical progression, and the spectrum of RAG methodologies and applications that have emerged post-LLMs. It is designed to equip readers and professionals with a detailed and structured understanding of both large models and RAG. It aims to illuminate the evolution of retrieval augmentation techniques, assess the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches in their respective contexts, and speculate on upcoming trends and innovations.

Summary of RAG ecosystem initial learning curve. 3) Specialization - optimizing RAG to better serve production environments. The mutual growth of RAG models and their technology stacks is evident; technological advancements continuously establish new standards for existing infrastructure. In turn, enhancements to the technology stack drive the development of RAG capabilities. RAG toolkits are converging into a foundational technology stack, laying the groundwork for advanced enterprise applications. However, a fully integrated, comprehensive platform concept is still in the future, requiring further innovation and development. F. Multi-modal RAG RAG has transcended its initial text-based question- answering confines, embracing a diverse array of modal data. This expansion has spawned innovative multimodal models that integrate RAG concepts across various domains: Image. RA-CM3 [176] stands as a pioneering multimodal model of both retrieving and generating text and images. BLIP-2 [177] leverages frozen image encoders alongside LLMs for efficient visual language pre-training, enabling zero- shot image-to-text conversions. The \\u201cVisualize Before You Write\\u201d method [178] employs image generation to steer the LM\\u2019s text generation, showing promise in open-ended text generation tasks. Audio and Video. The GSS method retrieves and stitches together audio clips to convert machine-translated data into speech-translated data [179]. UEOP marks a significant ad- vancement in end-to-end automatic speech recognition by incorporating external, offline strategies for voice-to-text con- version [180]. Additionally, KNN-based attention fusion lever- ages audio embeddings and semantically related text embed- dings to refine ASR, thereby accelerating domain adaptation. Vid2Seq augments language models with specialized temporal markers, facilitating the prediction of event boundaries and textual descriptions within a unified output sequence [181]. Code. RBPS [182] excels in small-scale learning tasks by retrieving code examples that align with developers\\u2019 objectives through encoding and frequency analysis. This approach has demonstrated efficacy in tasks such as test assertion genera- tion and program repair. For structured knowledge, the CoK method [106] first extracts facts pertinent to the input query from a knowledge graph, then integrates these facts as hints within the input, enhancing performance in knowledge graph question-answering tasks. VIII. CONCLUSION The summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 6, empha- sizes RAG\\u2019s significant advancement in enhancing the capa- bilities of LLMs by integrating parameterized knowledge from language models with extensive non-parameterized data from external knowledge bases. The survey showcases the evolution of RAG technologies and their application on many different tasks. The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms within the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modu- lar RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over its predecessors. RAG\\u2019s technical integration with other AI methodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, has further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in RAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve its robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts. RAG\\u2019s application scope is expanding into multimodal do- mains, adapting its principles to interpret and process diverse data forms like images, videos, and code. This expansion high- lights RAG\\u2019s significant practical implications for AI deploy- ment, attracting interest from academic and industrial sectors.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentences_list\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the generation, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain- specific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs\\u2019 intrin- sic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-the- art technologies embedded in each of these critical components, providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces up-to-date evalua- tion framework and benchmark. At the end, this article delineates the challenges currently faced and points out prospective avenues for research and development 1.

INTRODUCTION L ARGE language models (LLMs) have achieved remark- able success, though they still face significant limitations, especially in domain-specific or knowledge-intensive tasks [1], notably producing \\u201challucinations\\u201d [2] when handling queries beyond their training data or requiring current information. To overcome challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant document chunks from external knowledge base through semantic similarity calcu- lation. By referencing external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the problem of generating factually incorrect content. Its integration into LLMs has resulted in widespread adoption, establishing RAG as a key technology in advancing chatbots and enhancing the suitability of LLMs for real-world applica- tions. RAG technology has rapidly developed in recent years, and the technology tree summarizing related research is shown Corresponding Author.Email:haofen.wang@tongji.edu.cn 1Resources are available at https://github.com/Tongji-KGLLM/ RAG-Survey in Figure 1. The development trajectory of RAG in the era of large models exhibits several distinct stage characteristics. Initially, RAG\\u2019s inception coincided with the rise of the Transformer architecture, focusing on enhancing language models by incorporating additional knowledge through Pre- Training Models (PTM). This early stage was characterized by foundational work aimed at refining pre-training techniques [3]\\u2013[5].The subsequent arrival of ChatGPT [6] marked a pivotal moment, with LLM demonstrating powerful in context learning (ICL) capabilities. RAG research shifted towards providing better information for LLMs to answer more com- plex and knowledge-intensive tasks during the inference stage, leading to rapid development in RAG studies. As research progressed, the enhancement of RAG was no longer limited to the inference stage but began to incorporate more with LLM fine-tuning techniques. The burgeoning field of RAG has experienced swift growth, yet it has not been accompanied by a systematic synthesis that could clarify its broader trajectory. This survey endeavors to fill this gap by mapping out the RAG process and charting its evolution and anticipated future paths, with a focus on the integration of RAG within LLMs. This paper considers both technical paradigms and research methods, summarizing three main research paradigms from over 100 RAG studies, and analyzing key technologies in the core stages of \\u201cRetrieval,\\u201d \\u201cGeneration,\\u201d and \\u201cAugmentation.\\u201d On the other hand, current research tends to focus more on methods, lacking analysis and summarization of how to evaluate RAG. This paper compre- hensively reviews the downstream tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methods applicable to RAG. Overall, this paper sets out to meticulously compile and categorize the foundational technical concepts, historical progression, and the spectrum of RAG methodologies and applications that have emerged post-LLMs. It is designed to equip readers and professionals with a detailed and structured understanding of both large models and RAG. It aims to illuminate the evolution of retrieval augmentation techniques, assess the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches in their respective contexts, and speculate on upcoming trends and innovations. Our contributions are as follows: \\u2022 In this survey, we present a thorough and systematic review of the state-of-the-art RAG methods, delineating its evolution through paradigms including naive RAG, arXiv:2312.10997v5  [cs.CL]  27 Mar 2024\",\n          \"2 Fig. 1. Technology tree of RAG research. The stages of involving RAG mainly include pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference. With the emergence of LLMs, research on RAG initially focused on leveraging the powerful in context learning abilities of LLMs, primarily concentrating on the inference stage. Subsequent research has delved deeper, gradually integrating more with the fine-tuning of LLMs. Researchers have also been exploring ways to enhance language models in the pre-training stage through retrieval-augmented techniques. advanced RAG, and modular RAG. This review contex- tualizes the broader scope of RAG research within the landscape of LLMs. \\u2022 We identify and discuss the central technologies integral to the RAG process, specifically focusing on the aspects of \\u201cRetrieval\\u201d, \\u201cGeneration\\u201d and \\u201cAugmentation\\u201d, and delve into their synergies, elucidating how these com- ponents intricately collaborate to form a cohesive and effective RAG framework. \\u2022 We have summarized the current assessment methods of RAG, covering 26 tasks, nearly 50 datasets, outlining the evaluation objectives and metrics, as well as the current evaluation benchmarks and tools. Additionally, we anticipate future directions for RAG, emphasizing potential enhancements to tackle current challenges. The paper unfolds as follows: Section II introduces the main concept and current paradigms of RAG. The following three sections explore core components\\u2014\\u201cRetrieval\\u201d, \\u201cGen- eration\\u201d and \\u201cAugmentation\\u201d, respectively. Section III focuses on optimization methods in retrieval,including indexing, query and embedding optimization. Section IV concentrates on post- retrieval process and LLM fine-tuning in generation. Section V analyzes the three augmentation processes. Section VI focuses on RAG\\u2019s downstream tasks and evaluation system. Sec- tion VII mainly discusses the challenges that RAG currently faces and its future development directions. At last, the paper concludes in Section VIII. II. OVERVIEW OF RAG A typical application of RAG is illustrated in Figure 2. Here, a user poses a question to ChatGPT about a recent, widely discussed news. Given ChatGPT\\u2019s reliance on pre- training data, it initially lacks the capacity to provide up- dates on recent developments. RAG bridges this information gap by sourcing and incorporating knowledge from external databases. In this case, it gathers relevant news articles related to the user\\u2019s query. These articles, combined with the original question, form a comprehensive prompt that empowers LLMs to generate a well-informed answer. The RAG research paradigm is continuously evolving, and we categorize it into three stages: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG, as showed in Figure 3. Despite RAG method are cost-effective and surpass the performance of the native LLM, they also exhibit several limitations. The development of Advanced RAG and Modular RAG is a response to these specific shortcomings in Naive RAG. A.

      "**Here's how it works:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Retrieval:** A pre-trained model is used to retrieve relevant information from a large dataset. This information can be text, code, images, or other types of data.\n",
      "2. **Generation:** The retrieved information is then used as a prompt to generate new content, such as text, code, images, or other types of data.\n",

      "**Benefits of RAG:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Improved performance:** RAG can achieve state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, including text generation, code generation, and image generation.\n",
      "* **Robustness:** RAG is robust to noise and variations in the input data.\n",
      "* **Interpretability:** The generated content can be explained by the pre-trained retrieval model.\n",

      "['11 Fig.5.In addition to the most common once retrieval, RAG also includes three types of retrieval augmentation processes. (left) Iterative retrieval involves alternating between retrieval and generation, allowing for richer and more targeted context from the knowledge base at each step. (Middle) Recursive retrieval involves gradually refining the user query and breaking down the problem into sub-problems, then continuously solving complex problems through retrieval and generation. (', 'Right) Modular RAG inherits and develops from the previous paradigm, showcasing greater flexibility overall.This is evident in the introduction of multiple specific functional modules and the replacement of existing modules.The overall process is not limited to sequential retrieval and generation; it includes methods such as iterative and adaptive retrieval.Pre-retrieval process.In this stage, the primary focus is on optimizing the indexing structure and the original query.', '4 Fig.3.Comparison between the three paradigms of RAG. (Left) Naive RAG mainly consists of three parts: indexing, retrieval and generation. (Middle) Advanced RAG proposes multiple optimization strategies around pre-retrieval and post-retrieval, with a process similar to the Naive RAG, still following a chain-like structure. (', 'In the RAG system, both the step-back question and the original query are used for retrieval, and both the results are utilized as the basis for language model answer generation.3) Query Routing: Based on varying queries, routing to distinct RAG pipeline,which is suitable for a versatile RAG system designed to accommodate diverse scenarios.Metadata Router/ Filter.The first step involves extracting keywords (entity) from the query, followed by filtering based on the keywords and metadata within the chunks to narrow down the search scope.Semantic Router is another method of routing involves leveraging the semantic information of the query.', 'This step is crucial for enabling efficient similarity searches in the subsequent retrieval phase.Retrieval.Upon receipt of a user query, the RAG system employs the same encoding model utilized during the indexing phase to transform the query into a vector representation.It then computes the similarity scores between the query vector and the vector of chunks within the indexed corpus.The system prioritizes and retrieves the top K chunks that demonstrate the greatest similarity to the query.']\n"
